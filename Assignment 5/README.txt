Brief Description of Each Program:

      etest:
	This program will prompt the user to enter in an Employes data. It will make a struct containing that data as well as a couple other example structs.
	It will then save these structs to the file stest.txt in the current directory.

      etest-testmode:
	This program is the same as etest, except that it should output that it is a test file.

	writeTextfile:
	This program will prompt the user to enter how many employees they wish to create. It will then prompt for the information for each employee.
	When all the employees have been entered, it will make the employee structures and save those structures to the file etest2.txt. Before exiting,
	the program will free all the allocated memory used by the structs.

	readEmployees:
	This program will read the file etest.txt (generated by program etest) and create an employee struct for each employee found in the file. It will
	print these employees to the terminal. Before exiting, the program will free all the allocated memory used by the structs.

	binaryWriteTextfile:
	This program will prompt the user to enter how many employees they wish to create. It will then prompt for the information for each employee.
	When all the employees have been entered, it will make the employee structures and save those structures to a binary file called  etest2.bin.
	Before exiting, the program will free all the allocated memory used by the structs.

	binaryReadEmployees:
	This program will read the binary file etest2.bin and create an employee struct for each employee found in the file. It will print these
	employees to the terminal. Before exiting, the program will free all the allocated memory used by the structs.


Compilation instructions:


Instructions on How to Compile and Link Programs:

	etest: Use make to compile the program and create the executable ctest.
	       Use ./ctest from the command line to run the executable.

	       *Run all programs same as etest.
