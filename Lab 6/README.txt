Description of Program(s):

  stacktest:
            This program implements a stack in the C programming language. This program runs three different 
            tests to make sure the stack functions properly. The program checks that the stack is correctly storing
            elements in LIFO format, that the stack properly handles overflows, and that you cannot pop more elements
            off the stack than are currently in the stack.
            
How to Run:

          1. Navigate to the appropriate file directory
          2. Run make within the directory
          3. After making the executable run it with: ./stacktest
